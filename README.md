Game Development Department 

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.



This website is to bring a fictional game company into real life. It is mainly based off the Game Development Department from Blue Archive, which has
4 members that all share a love for console games. Because they love console games so much, they have deciede to make their own game from scratch. So far, two games
have been published. This website is a medium for this company to put their games up to let other people experience their game and to give reviews on how well the game 
was made. A suggestions page is added so people can leave reviews after they have tried the game.


Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

feedback form:
empty message will return invalid
empty name will not return invalid


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
while making the website, trying to view it on mobile causes a whitespace the the right side.

you need to click on the text and not the image itself to access the other pages.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
